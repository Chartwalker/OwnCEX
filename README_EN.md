# OwnCEX
A own CEX in the pocket

In the event of a blackout, even if you own a solar system, no power will come from the roof because all the inverters will fail in the event of a power outage. And if the inverters in rented systems cannot switch to island or hybrid operation, even though the conversion is technically possible, you won't be able to operate your cooling system, your heating system, or your banking.

The first step, therefore, is to become fully self-sufficient in every respect and build your self-sufficiency network and connect it to other self-sufficiency networks without using the internet, either wirelessly or via satellite.

This is precisely one of the seven components of full self-sufficiency in this case. The other six are in other repositories or hardware projects. More on this later in the documentation.

Without constant access to assets, a blackout, along with a war involving robbery and looting, becomes a life-threatening scenario that should be considered in advance. The project implements a concept that has been sitting in my drawer since the summer of 2000, constantly being dug out and improved upon, and now finally implemented 1:1.

An OwnCEX is a centralized exchange with its own money pool and gateway to classic cryptocurrencies, but operates with gold-backed tokens in its own pocket. 100 users each deposit a margin and then trade together on their own index, which ensures the segregated liquidity of all 100 OwnCEXs through "proof of stake," but is not dependent on electricity or the internet.

You therefore receive gas fees for payment processing and dividends for gold deposits and withdrawals. You can also use the network's profits to gradually release your own solar system from the lease with crypto and forex profits and convert it accordingly with loans from the money pool in exchange for the transfer of electricity revenues to become fully self-sufficient.

The shared money pool can be used for this purpose, as long as the other 99 participants remain accessible via radio or satellite and also improve their interference immunity. This means that each CEX needs a blackout-proof two-way connection to at least six other CEXs, which in turn each have six link partners and money pools that can hear each other via at least two channels and all continue to operate in the event of a blackout.

For this purpose, gold-backed cryptocurrencies are used, which do not require a blockchain and maintain their value by depositing precious metals, rather than securing it through mining or minting.

This particular cryptocurrency is deposited in 100 individual units across all other OwnCEX accounts, and no one can withdraw their share without the consent of the other 99 OwnCEX users, unless a replacement is found to replenish that share. The 99 other CEX users hold varying proportions of the total assets, similar to a broker. As long as the margin secures each OwnCEX account, there are no issues for the other 99 participants. The liquidity is at least five times higher than the individual user's liquidity, and an additional OwnCEX account serves as a standby in case of a failback. Therefore, there are at least six participants in each ring, and each ring must contain an odd number of participants.
